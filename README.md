# A Multivariate Statistical Analysis of UN-FAO Data on Food Security and Nutrition: An Inferential Perspective With Respect To India

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the food security and nutrition status in India using multivariate statistical techniques on data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (UN-FAO). The study utilizes principal component analysis, factor analysis, and regression models to explore the relationships among key indicators and understand the changing food security challenges in India.

## Data Description
<ul>
  <li>Source: United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (UN-FAO)</li>
  <li>Time Span: 2000 to 2022</li>
  <li>Factors: 25 factors influencing food security and nutrition</li>
  <li>Comparative Study: Examines G20 countries with an exclusive focus on India</li>
</ul>

## Methodology
<ul>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analyses using box plots, correlation matrices, bar graphs, and line graphs to visualize and understand data patterns and outliers.</li>
  <li>Descriptive Analysis: Calculation of the coefficient of variation (C.V.) for each criterion and consistency ranking.</li>
  <li>Multivariate Statistical Analysis:
    <ul>
      <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Identifies significant variables and assesses correlation structures among indicators.</li>
      <li>Factor Analysis: Identifies latent factors underlying observed variables and interprets them in the context of real-world and policy implications.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

## Objectives
Understand the intricate dynamics of food security and nutrition in India.
Provide insights for evidence-based policymaking.
Offer a model for addressing food security challenges in other regions.
